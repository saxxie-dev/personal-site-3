    The year is 1739, and the brilliant philosopher David Hume has a problem. 
    He's trying to re-derive the ancient theory of ethics and morality from a truly _rigorous_ foundation, one based on the still-developing science of _formal logic_.
    Unfortunately, his valiant attempts all fail. **Why?**

    The year is 1992, and the brilliant computer scientist Philip Wadler has a problem. 
    He's trying to reinvent the practice of programming complex systems from a truly _rigorous_ foundation, one based on the still-developing study of _pure, statically-typed functional programming_.
    Unfortunately, his valiant attempts all fail. **Why?**

    Intuitively, the problem arises from the fact that morality is about things that *should* happen (you *should* not kick that puppy), while logic is about things that *are* (puppies *exist*!).

    Consider trying to convey your ethics to a particularly pedantic toddler: 
    <div class="pl-2 border-l-[1px] border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700">
      _You_: You should not kick that puppy.  
      _Toddler_: Why?   
      _You_: Because it's evil.  
      _Toddler_: Why shouldn't I be evil?   
      _You_: Because if you're evil, you'll get put in jail, and then you'll be sad.  
      _Toddler_: Why shouldn't I want to be sad?  
    </div>

    Our (mildly psychopathic) toddler has a good point, really. Even if we had clear-cut, uncontroversial definitions of good and evil and pleasure and pain and so on,
    we would still have no way of reaching the conclusion that we **ought** to do any particular thing. This is known as the [Is-Ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is-ought_problem) -- that we cannot derive an "ought" from an "is".
  </div>
  <div slot="right">
    Intuitively, the problem arises from the fact that practical programming is about IO (input/output) *processes* (download that suspicious `.exe`), while functions are about *calculations* (the sum of numebrs in a list).
  
    Consider trying to test your program against a particularly unhelpful compiler: 
     <div class="pl-2 border-l-[1px] border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 text-left">
      _You_: Test this code: `println("hello world")`. It should return `void` when it runs.  
      _Computer_: . . . Done! The program returned `void`.  
      _You_: Hmm. I'm not seeing anything. I guess I should [mock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_double) `println` to verify it was being called.  
      _Computer_: . . . Done! I ran `fake.println("hello world")`.  
      _You_: A good sign - but not a guarantee! Depends on how `println` and `fake.println` are related.
    </div>
    In general, this is a real problem! With automated tests, it can be difficult to verify that any IO-heavy code is doing its job.
    Replacing the IO with similar but fake *pure* computations helps kick the can down the road -- we have no guarantee that our fake computations are accurately simulating the IO that should've been performed!

    Let's try and make our intuition a little more rigorous. To do that we'll review the language of formal logic (in particular, the [propositional calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus)) to see what it can and cannot do. 

    An arbitrary letter, such as $A$, $B$, $X$, etc. is denoted a **proposition** - it represents a truth value.
    On their own, most such propositions are not very interesting!
    For example, saying "$A$" simply means "the proposition $A$ is true".

    An arrow - $A \to B$ - represents an _implication_ - that $A$ **implies** $B$. 
    This is the case if $B$ is true whenever $A$ is true. Note that if $A$ is false, then $B$ can trivially be either true _or_ false.
    Given $A \to B$, and also knowing that $A$, we can infer that $B$ via an simple inference rule pretentiously known as [modus ponens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens).
  
    One basic way of conceptualizing the process of logical reasoning is as the composition of a bunch of implications. 
    For example, if $A \to B$ and $B \to C$, then $A \to C$ -- given an $A$ we can infer $B$ via the first assumption, and then from $B$ we can infer $C$ via the second assumption.

    Obviously, there's obviously a bit more to logic than this, but it's all we'll need for now.

    Let's try and make our intuition a little more rigorous. To do that we'll review the language of types and functions (in particular, the [typed lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typed_lambda_calculus)) to see what it can and cannot do.
  
    An arbitrary letter, such as `A`, `B`, `X` etc. is denoted a **type** - it represents a collection of possible values. 
    On their own, most such types are not very interesting!
    For example, saying "`a: A`" simply means "`a` is contained in the collection of values represented by `A`".

    An arrow - `A → B` - represents the type of a _function_ going from `A` to `B`.
    A value of this type is an algorithm which computes a value of type `B` for any possible value of type `A`. Note that if `A` is the empty type (containing no values), then such a function trivially exists for every other `B`. 
    Given `f: A → B`, and also a value `a: A`, we can compute a value of type `f(a): B` via an simple calculation known as [function evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)).
  
    One basic way of conceptualizing the process of programming is as the composition of a bunch of functions. 
    For example, if `f: A → B` and `g: B → C`, then `g ∘ f: A → C` is a function as well -- given an `a: A` we can compute a value of type `g(f(a)): C`.

    Obviously, there's obviously a bit more to functional programming than this, but it's all we'll need for now.

    Given this review, perhaps the limitations of pure logic with respect to morality are becoming clearer.  

    Not only is there no way to _derive_ an "ought" from an "is"; there's not even a way to _express_ an "ought" in the first place! 
    The syntax of the language simply doesn't have any constructs thst could correspond to notions of an **obligation**.
    If everything is merely an inference about the current state of the world, that leaves no room for describing obligations of how to *change* the world.

    Given this review, perhaps the limitations of functional programming with respect to IO are becoming clearer.  

    Not only is there no way to _create_ an IO process from a pure function; there's not even a way to _express_ effectfulness in the first place!
    The syntax of the language simply doesn't have any constructs that could correspond to notions of **IO**. 
    If everything is merely a mapping from input values to output values, that leaves no room for functions to _actually_ be doing other things.

    Philosophers were thus presented with a choice.

    Either give up on studying ethics, since it can't be perfectly embedded in basic logic, or find some way to _enrich_ the logic with an extra layer of expressiveness, one that
    is capable of expressing moral judgements. 

    Thanks to heavy lobbying from the philosophy-industrial complex, which occasionally generates nonzero profits from ethics research, philosophers decided on the latter option: enriching the base logic.

    Programmers were thus presented with a choice.

    Either give up on writing software that *does* stuff, since it can't be perfectly embedded in lambda calculus, or find some way to _enrich_ the language with an extra layer of expressiveness, one that is capable of\
    describing the side effects associated with running a program. 

    Thanks to heavy lobbying from computer users everywhere, who occasionally enjoy running programs on physical computers, the language designers decided on the latter option: enriching the base language.

    To extend our base logic, we introduce a new *modality* for *moral obligation*. Don't freak out about the new vocabulary!
    
    A *modality* is essentially "truth mode", or distinct way in which an existing expression can be true. 
    Propositions with our *obligation modality* will thus be used to describe whether something *ought* to be true, independently of whether it actually is. 
    
    Modalities are often denoted geometric symbols, such as $\Box$ or $\Diamond$; for our moral obligation modality, we'll use $\Box$. 
    Correspondingly, if you have a moral obligation to do $X$, we can express this as $\Box X$.

    Crucially, $\Box X$ is distinct and incomparable to $X$! If I am given $\Box \lnot[\text{kick puppies}]$ "you should not kick puppies", that (unfortunately) does not imply 
    $\lnot[\text{kick puppies}]$ "puppies are never kicked".

    This gives a somewhat infectious quality - once we've started reaching moral judgements, it's difficult to extract purely logical facts from it - instead, we'll likely push more stuff *inside* the $\Box$ modality
    (via techniques we'll see soon) to reach more sophisticated ethical conclusions. 
  </div>
  <div slot="right">
    To extend our base type system, we introduce a new *monad* for *IO operations*.  Don't freak out about the new vocabulary! 
    
    A *monad* is essentially a "calculation mode", or distinct way in which "values" of a type may be computed. 
    Values in our IO monad will thus specify processes for running programs that require the use of side effects. 
    
    Our IO monad will be denoted `IO`. 
    Correspondingly, if we have some effectful process which returns a value of type `X`, we can express this as `myProcess: IO X`.

    Crucially, `IO X` is distinct and incomparable to `X`! If I am given an `IO Int` - a number retrieved from a user input, there is no way to extract an `Int` - pure computation yielding the same number! 
    
    This gives a somewhat infectious quality - once we've started doing some `IO`, it's impossible to pull it back into the world of pure functions - instead, we have to push more stuff *inside* the `IO` 
    (via techniques we'll see soon) to create more sophisticated effectful programs.
