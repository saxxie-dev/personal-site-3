# Getting Started with Astro

Welcome to our guide on getting started with Astro! In this post, we'll explore some web development concepts and even include some mathematical formulas to demonstrate KaTeX rendering.

## The Beauty of Mathematics in Web Development

Sometimes, we need to display mathematical equations in our web content. Here are some examples:

The quadratic formula is one of the most famous equations in mathematics:

$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula:

$$ E = mc^2 $$

And here's a more complex example, the Euler's identity:

$$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 $$

You can also use inline math like this: $f(x) = x^2$ or $\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

## LaTeX Environments

Here's a matrix example:

$$
\begin{matrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{matrix}
$$

And an aligned equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx}e^x &= e^x \\
\frac{d}{dx}\ln(x) &= \frac{1}{x} \\
\frac{d}{dx}\sin(x) &= \cos(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Why Astro?

Now, back to web development! Astro is a modern static site generator that offers:

1. **Component Islands**: Deliver zero JavaScript by default
2. **Server-first API**: Move expensive operations to the build step
3. **Zero Configuration**: Sensible defaults that just work
4. **Fully Featured**: Markdown, MDX, TypeScript, Scoped CSS, and more

## Getting Started

To create a new Astro project, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

This will set up a new Astro project with all the essential features you need to get started.
